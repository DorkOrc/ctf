LIST OF THINGS TO CHANGE WHEN WORLD IS COPIED BACK!!!
THOROUGHLY PLAYTEST TO ENSURE THERE AREN'T ANY ISSUES:
- Players can't pick up a flag when they are
    a) in their own territory
    b) currently holding a flag
    (this was an issue at one point; i tried to fix it, couldn't find any issues, went back to examine further and found that it was no longer an issue.
    this makes me believe that it may happen again since i never found the cause; but maybe i changed something that fixed it permanently without realizing it.)

ISSUES
- Look into why "cherry", "desert", "ice", "mesa" and "forest" appear a slightly different number of times as one another

- If there is a player on the team where a flag is hidden that is CLOSER to the flag than another player on the enemy team, but both are within range to pick it up, the
  enemy team player will attempt to pick up the flag, but since the player in their own biome is closer, it'll go to them instead.
    * example: flag hidden in mesa biome. mesa player standing 0.1 blocks away from the flag. cherry player standing 0.3 blocks away from the flag. cherry player picks up the
               flag, triggering the flag carrying sequence. because the mesa player is CLOSER than the cherry player, they get the flag instead of the cherry player.
    * this is a minor edgecase so i'll fix it with low priority 
    //I think this one might be fixed, but check line 77-78 just in case so I didn't break anything

- Sometimes when placing the flag, the countdown doesn't stop //probably fixed
- Team leader should spawn in a slightly different spot so that when the flag item is summoned on them, they are definitely going to pick it up rather than someone else //fixed, I think?? Even if they shouldn't be able to pick it up, they can... at the start a least
- Flag glows instead of players on intro sequence //fixed
- Everyone is sometimes given a warped fungus on a stick, not just the leader [might be fixed, pls check //tbh looking at the code I don't see how this could happen]
- Creative players can pick up flag //fixed
- Flags disappearing randomly
- Forest jail doesn't have lava //added
- Sidebar doesnt update properly //most likely fixed, the update function was missing for forest
- Team Indication (add dyed leather boots and leggings depending on what team people are on; ideally dyed the same color as the storage minecraft:colors) //added

TODOS
- Flags
    * Fix flag holders losing contact with flags on logout; make flags just drop right there on logout //I added something that I think works, but can't really test it in single player due to the datapack reloading
- Win condition; add:
    * Most flags owned by any team after 1 hour
